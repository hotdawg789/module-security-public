# CloudTrail Example

This is an example of how to use the [cloudtrail module](/modules/cloudtrail) to enable AWS CloudTrail on your AWS account.

This example will create an S3 Bucket where CloudTrail events can be stored, a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) used to
encrypt CloudTrail events, and a CloudTrail "Trail" itself to enable API events to be recorded and stored in S3.

See the [cloudtrail module](/modules/cloudtrail) for additional details.

## Quick start

To try these templates out you must have Terraform installed:

1. Open `variables.tf` and fill in any variables that don't have a default.
1. Run `terraform init` to instruct Terraform to perform initialization steps.
1. Run `terraform plan` to confirm that Terraform will create what looks like a reasonable set of resources.
1. Run `terraform apply` to enable CloudTrail.
1. Now log into the AWS Web Console, go to the CloudTrail service, and within a few minutes you should see records of
   API events available for browsing.
