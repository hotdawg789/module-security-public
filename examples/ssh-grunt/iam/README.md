# SSH Grunt with IAM Example

This is an example of how to install [ssh-grunt](/modules/ssh-grunt) on an EC2 Instance so that you can manage SSH
access for the Instance with AWS [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) (if you're looking
for how to use `ssh-grunt` with Houston, see the [ssh-grunt Houston example](/examples/ssh-grunt/houston). You can
upload your public SSH Key to your IAM user account and `ssh-grunt` will allow you to SSH to the EC2 Instances using
your IAM user name and SSH key for authentication.




## Quick start

To try these templates out you must have Terraform and Packer installed:

1. Upload your public SSH Key to IAM as documented in the [ssh-grunt README](/modules/ssh-grunt).
1. Build the AMI for `ssh-grunt` with IAM by following the
   [instructions in the packer folder](/examples/ssh-grunt/packer).
1. Open `variables.tf`, set the environment variables specified at the top of the file, and fill in any other variables that
   don't have a default, including the ID of the AMI you built in the previous step.
1. Run `terraform init`.
1. Run `terraform apply`.
1. When the templates are done applying, you'll see the IP address of the EC2 Instance. You should now be able to SSH
   to it using your IAM username and the public key you uploaded in step 1: `ssh <IAM-USERNAME>@<SERVER-IP>`.
