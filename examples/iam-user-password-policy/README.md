# IAM User Password Policy Example

This is an example of how to use the [iam-user-password-policy module](/modules/iam-user-password-policy) to setup a
policy that governs requirements for all IAM User passwords.

This example will apply the policy in the AWS account and overwrite any other existing policy.

See the [iam-user-password-policy module](/modules/iam-user-password-policy) for additional details.

## Quick start

To try these templates out you must have Terraform installed:

1. Open `variables.tf` and fill in any variables that don't have a default.
1. Review the hardcoded values in `main.tf`.
1. Run `terraform init` to instruct Terraform to perform initialization steps.
1. Run `terraform apply` to apply the password policy.
