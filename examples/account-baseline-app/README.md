# AWS App Account Baseline Example

This is an example of how to use the [account-baseline-app](/modules/account-baseline-app) to establish a security baseline
for AWS Landing Zone for configuring the app accounts (e.g., dev, stage, prod) of an AWS Organization - including setting up AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail,
Amazon Guard Duty, IAM users, IAM groups, IAM password policy, and more.

## Quick start

To try these templates out you must have Terraform installed:

1. Open `variables.tf` and fill in any variables that don't have a default.
1. Run `terraform init` to instruct Terraform to perform initialization steps.
1. Run `terraform plan` to confirm that Terraform will create what looks like a reasonable set of resources.
1. Run `terraform apply -parallelism=4`. We recommend using a `-parallelism` flag for stable performance as this module can peg all of your CPU cores and cause timeout/network connectivity errors.
1. Now log into the AWS Web Console, and locate your new artifacts in IAM, Config, GuardDuty, etc.
