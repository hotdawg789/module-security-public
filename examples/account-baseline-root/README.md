# AWS Root Account Baseline Example

This is an example of how to use the [account-baseline-root](/modules/account-baseline-root) to establish security baseline
for AWS Landing Zone for configuring the root account (AKA master account) of an AWS Organization - including setting up child accounts,
AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon Guard Duty, IAM users, IAM groups, IAM password policy, and more.

**NOTE:** Destroying the example via `terraform destroy` or removing entries from `child_accounts` will only remove an AWS account from an organization.
Terraform **will not close the account**. The member account must be prepared to be a standalone account beforehand.
See the [AWS Organizations documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html)
for more information.

## Quick start

To try these templates out you must have Terraform installed:

1. Open `variables.tf` and fill in any variables that don't have a default.
1. Run `terraform init` to instruct Terraform to perform initialization steps.
1. Run `terraform plan` to confirm that Terraform will create what looks like a reasonable set of resources.
1. Run `terraform apply -parallelism=4`. We recommend using a `-parallelism` flag for stable performance as this module can peg all of your CPU cores and cause timeout/network connectivity errors.
1. Now log into the AWS Web Console, go to the Organizations console, and locate your new child accounts.
