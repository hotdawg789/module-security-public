# A best-practices set of IAM roles for SAML access

This module can be used to allow users authenticated via external Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity
providers such as Google, Amazon SSO, Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Okta, and OneLogin to access
your AWS accounts ([saml-access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html)).
This allows you to define each environment (mgmt, stage, prod, etc) in a separate AWS account and to use SAML to assume
different roles in each account.

If you're not familiar with IAM concepts, start with the [Background Information](#background-information) section as a
way to familiarize yourself with the terminology.

## How do you use this module?

To set up SAML access to AWS, you need to:

1. [Create an Identity Provider in each account](#create-identity-provider)
1. [Create IAM roles in each of your accounts](#create-iam-roles)
1. [Create permissions to assume the IAM roles in other accounts](#create-permissions-to-assume-the-iam-roles-in-other-accounts)

This module takes care of [creating IAM roles](#create-iam-roles) and [creating the appropriate permissions](#create-permissions-to-assume-the-iam-roles-in-other-accounts). Check out the [saml-iam-roles
example](/examples/saml-iam-roles) for a working sample code of how to use this module.

### Create Identity Provider in IAM

If you want to allow users of a SAML Identity Provider (IdP) to access your AWS accounts, you will first need to create a SAML Identity Provider within IAM. You will also have to configure your IdP to send the appropriate assertions as described in the
[AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml_assertions.html).

### Create IAM roles in each account

If you want to allow users from SAML IdPs to access your AWS accounts, use this module in each AWS account to create IAM roles that specify which services those users may access.

### Create permissions to assume the IAM roles in other accounts

Finally, this module will also grant access to users of each SAML provider listed in the various
`allow_*_access_from_saml_provider_arns` variables to assume the corresponding role.

## Resources Created

This module creates the following IAM roles (all optional):

* **allow-read-only-access-from-saml**: Users authenticated by the SAML providers in
 `var.allow_read_only_access_from_saml_provider_arns` will get read-only access to all services in this account.

* **allow-billing-access-from-saml**: Users authenticated by the SAML providers in
  `var.allow_billing_access_from_saml_provider_arns` will get full (read and write) access to the billing details for
  this account.

* **allow-support-access-from-saml**: Users authenticated by the SAML providers in
  `var.allow_support_access_from_saml_provider_arns` will get access to AWS support for this account.

* **allow-logs-access-from-saml**: Users authenticated by the SAML providers in
  `var.allow_logs_access_from_saml_provider_arns` will get read access to the logs in CloudTrail, AWS Config, and
  CloudWatch for this account. Since CloudTrail logs may be encrypted with a KMS CMK, if `var.cloudtrail_kms_key_arn` is
  set, these users will also get permissions to decrypt using this KMS CMK.

* **allow-ssh-grunt-access-from-saml**: Users authenticated by the SAML providers in
  `var.allow_ssh_grunt_access_from_saml_provider_arns` will get read access to IAM Groups and public SSH keys. This is
  useful to allow [ssh-grunt](/modules/ssh-grunt) running on EC2 Instances in other AWS accounts to validate SSH
  connections against IAM users defined in this AWS account.

* **allow-dev-access-from-saml**:Users authenticated by the SAML providers in
  `var.allow_dev_access_from_saml_provider_arns` will get full (read and write) access to the services in this account
  specified in `var.dev_permitted_services`.

* **allow-full-access-from-saml**: Users authenticated by the SAML providers in
  `var.allow_full_access_from_saml_provider_arns` will get full (read and write) access to all services in this account.

* **allow-iam-admin-access-from-saml**: Users authenticated by the SAML providers in
  `var.allow_iam_admin_access_from_saml_provider_arns` will get full IAM (`iam:*`) access in this account.

* **allow-auto-deploy-access-from-saml**: Users authenticated by the SAML providers in
  `var.allow_read_only_access_from_saml_provider_arns` will get automated deployment access to all services in this
  account with the permissions specified in `var.auto_deploy_permissions`. The main use case is to allow a CI server
  (e.g. Jenkins) in another AWS account to do automated deployments in this AWS account.
